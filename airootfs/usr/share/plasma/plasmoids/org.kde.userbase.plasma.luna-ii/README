Description
-----------

This plasmoid displays the current phase of the moon and shows the dates
of the important moon phases in the same month (last new moon, first quarter,
full moon, third quarter and next new moon). You can navigate to previous or
future moon phases by clicking the arrow keys. Clicking the middle button
returns to the current dates.

This plasmoid is a port to Plasma 5 of Luna QML 1.4 (https://store.kde.org/p/1002036/)

Installation
------------

A. Command line, installs to ~/local/share/plasma/plasmoids

   This works the same way as loading a new widget from "Add Widgets..."

   Install:    $ plasmapkg2 -i Luna-II-<ver>.plasmoid

   Update:     $ plasmapkg2 -u Luna-II-<ver>.plasmoid

   Uninstall:  $ plasmapkg2 -r org.kde.userbase.plasma.luna-ii

   See README_TRANSLATIONS.txt (Step 4) for installing localisations.

B. Command line, installs to /usr/local/share/plasma/plasmoids

   Install:   # plasmapkg2 -g -i Luna-II-<ver>.plasmoid

   Update:    # plasmapkg2 -g -u Luna-II-<ver>.plasmoid

   Uninstall: # plasmapkg2 -g -r org.kde.userbase.plasma.luna-ii

   See README_TRANSLATIONS.txt (Step 4) for installing localisations.

C. CMake, installs to /usr/local/share/plasma/plasmoids

   WARNING: this works but is not really maintained.

  0. Unpack Luna-II-<ver>.plasmoid - it's a zip file.
  1. The top directory contains the CMakeLists.txt file
  2. Create an empty directory, luna-ii-plasmoid-build, and cd into it
  3. Run: # cmake <path to source dir>
  4. Run: # make install

  See README_TRANSLATIONS.txt (Step 4) for installing localisations.

Custom Date Formats
-------------------
For example: dddd, dd-MM-yyyy  => Saturday, 10-Dec-2016

 d    the day as number without a leading zero (1 to 31)
 dd   the day as number with a leading zero (01 to 31)
 ddd  the abbreviated localized day name (e.g. 'Mon' to 'Sun'). Uses QDate::shortDayName().
 dddd the long localized day name (e.g. 'Monday' to 'Qt::Sunday'). Uses QDate::longDayName().
 M    the month as number without a leading zero (1-12)
 MM   the month as number with a leading zero (01-12)
 MMM  the abbreviated localized month name (e.g. 'Jan' to 'Dec'). Uses QDate::shortMonthName().
 MMMM the long localized month name (e.g. 'January' to 'December'). Uses QDate::longMonthName().
 yy   the year as two digit number (00-99)
 yyyy the year as four digit number

In addition the following expressions can be used to specify the time:
 h   the hour without a leading zero (0 to 23 or 1 to 12 if AM/PM display)
 hh  the hour with a leading zero (00 to 23 or 01 to 12 if AM/PM display)
 m   the minute without a leading zero (0 to 59)
 mm  the minute with a leading zero (00 to 59)
 s   the second without a leading zero (0 to 59)
 ss  the second with a leading zero (00 to 59)
 z   the milliseconds without leading zeroes (0 to 999)
 zzz the milliseconds with leading zeroes (000 to 999)
 AP  use AM/PM display. AP will be replaced by either "AM" or "PM".
 ap  use am/pm display. ap will be replaced by either "am" or "pm".

Possible bug warning
--------------------

In contents/code/lunacalc.js a reasonable lower approximation for the number
of lunations since the New Moon of January 6, 2000 is calculated in order to
reduce the number of iterations in a costly while loop and thus speed up the
startup of the plasmoid.  Since the lunation duration is not fixed, it may
happen that the calculated number of lunations is too high, and then the
plasmoid will display phases of the moon which are one month in the future.
Since the average lunation duration is used, this bug will only occasionaly
appear, if it appears at all.  This can be solved by setting the variable
lunationDuration to a higher value (with the negative impact that the startup
of the plasmoid may be slower).
